## Just Like Rays

A mod that overhaul minecraft block light engine to behave more like real light with the power of FBGBV! (so for example, walls will cast shadows)

This mod is in early alpha. Core content is there but there be dragons! (and edge cases)


##### Info:

- Only compatible with worlds generated with this mod active (for save format reasons)


##### Todo/Roadmap:

- fix multi updates behaviors
- impl mc face based opacity
- tweaking mc border chunk system to fix ranges above 15
- settings (radius, intensity, etc)

##### Maybe/Far future:

- par face light level data instead of per block (1 block large corridors would look much better)
- tweaking the renderer to make use of the additionnal light level data
- RGB light
- paralelization of the GBV algorithm
